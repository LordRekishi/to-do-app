# To-do App demo

This is a very simple demo to compare Options API with the newer Compositions API. 
Practice for one of my courses at IT-HÃ¶gskolan, Gothenburg.

### Functionality:
1. Change between the Options API and the Compositions API Router views with the buttons on top of the page.
2. Add new To-do by entering a name in the input field and press Enter.
3. Remove a To-do by clicking the "X" button next to it.
4. The input for new To-do have a watcher to check for swearwords ("fart", "butt hair", "willy") and will give an alert if these are entered.
5. The h1 title on to of the input will update using a computed call to calculate the todo array's length.
